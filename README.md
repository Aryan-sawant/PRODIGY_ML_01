# House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

## Overview

This Colab notebook implements a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, bedroom count, and bathroom count. The project leverages popular Python libraries, including scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas, to facilitate data analysis and model development.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical data on house prices and associated features:

- `SquareFootage`: Total square footage of the house.
- `Bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms in the house.
- `Bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms in the house.
- `Price`: The target variable, representing the house price.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas

You can install them using pip:

```bash
!pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas
